Hi, welcome to my new website!

### The Motivation Many Years Ago

I have long wanted to create my own website to express my thoughts in a longer form. I actually already created one back when I worked in my previous company (Hitachi Zosen; now called Kanadevia).

At the time, I wanted to try having my website to start writing and build a brand for myself. However, due to my lack of motivation and bad website framework, I decided to scrap that old one (there is no blog post anyway) and create a new one with GitHub Pages.

### First Iteration V1.0

To be honest, I just wanted a free and simple personal website. I don't need any fancy features, as long as I can write my post and it is neat.

I first wanted to create my website while reading about note-taking. I read many random websites and Reddit posts until I stumbled upon [Ratfactor](https://ratfactor.com/) by Dave Gauer. I was fascinated, firstly, by his simple yet great notebook system and, secondly, by his lightweight website.

My first website iteration was using Google Sites. It was very clean, indeed. However, I didn't like how I had to update the website to post my blog posts manually. (Maybe it was just because I didn't bother to search for an efficient way to do it)

### Second Iteration V2.0

For my second website iteration, I actually got the idea two years ago after seeing my friend Jafar's personal website ([here](https://ajarifi.github.io/)). His website was also pretty neat, and then I noticed the URL, GitHub.

I then searched about it and found out about [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I like the customizable theme (with many templates) and the very simple blog post organization. Basically, to add a new blog post, just push a Git commit with the blog post formatted in Markdown in the posts folder, which I am familiar with. (I still can't say I am good with Git and Markdown, though.)

Then, when I found out that GitHub Pages is free and can use custom URLs, it was a no-brainer to choose it.

### Third Iteration V3.0
Fast-forward two years, and I haven't made any blog posts on the second website. It turned out I was too lazy and unmotivated.

This year, I thought to myself, I would like to make my ambitions a reality. For the last few years, I have been on and off in autopilot mode. While in recent years I felt much more in control, I felt I hadn't done anything very productive beyond my work.

Finally, after almost two years of delay, I launched my third iteration of my website (this one) and posted a fitting first blog post today!

I hope this is not yet another futile attempt. Let's see how this unfolds.
