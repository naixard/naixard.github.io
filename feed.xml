My already limited free time at night after full-time work during the day was gone to oblivion, just to read and watch useless information.</p> <p>I felt like my life was on autopilot. Suddenly, I realized some months had passed last year. Last year was probably my busiest year due to my wedding, but still, after that, everything else felt quick.</p> <p>After I read Cal Newport’s book Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World, I understood what was (maybe) happening to me. I spent too much time on shallow tasks, like browsing social media and using my smartphone, instead of doing deep work, which requires long uninterrupted concentration.</p> <p>For some weeks before I read this book, my average screen time was around six hours/day. <em>That’s equal to my whole evening after work!</em> For comparison, my wife’s average screen time was around one to two hours/day.</p> <p>Like the saying, “The phone is smart the person isn’t.” I know I must change this.</p> <h3 id="embracing-boredom">Embracing Boredom</h3> <p>After reading this book, I applied some of his advice, such as not using social media or time-blocking. One thing among the others is “embrace boredom.” As I understand it, try letting your mind get bored without seeking entertainment. In my case, I basically try not to open my smartphone when bored (like when waiting). <em>Well, it is hard.</em></p> <p>The first few days were fine, but recently, I started going back to my old habit of looking at my phone. It seems I need to train my mind to do this.</p> <p>I remember a deep work occasion during the <em>Pelatnas</em> (Indonesian term, <em>“Pelatihan Nasional”</em>, meaning “National Training”) for International Olympiad of Astronomy and Astrophysics during my highschool days. I fondly remember there being no smartphone at that time. We were able to work long hours just to study college-level astronomy and astrophysics classes from the top university professors of the subjects in Indonesia (or maybe in SEA). Honestly, I want to return to that level of focus.</p> <p>Back to the book, I really liked Deep Work. Cal Newport successfully reminded me of the critical things I was missing by forfeiting my time to shallow entertainment. I recommend giving this book a read if you feel the same way, if you feel your time is lost to the internet.</p>]]></content><author><name>Adrian</name></author><category term="book"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until recently, I was overwhelmed by social media.

I actually already created one back when I worked in my previous company (Hitachi Zosen; now called Kanadevia).</p> <p>At the time, I wanted to try having my website to start writing and build a brand for myself. However, due to my lack of motivation and bad website framework, I decided to scrap that old one (there is no blog post anyway) and create a new one with GitHub Pages.</p> <h3 id="first-iteration-v10">First Iteration V1.0</h3> <p>To be honest, I just wanted a free and simple personal website. I don’t need any fancy features, as long as I can write my post and it is neat.</p> <p>I first wanted to create my website while reading about note-taking. I read many random websites and Reddit posts until I stumbled upon <a href="https://ratfactor.com/">Ratfactor</a> by Dave Gauer. I was fascinated, firstly, by his simple yet great notebook system and, secondly, by his lightweight website.</p> <p>My first website iteration was using Google Sites. It was very clean, indeed. However, I didn’t like how I had to update the website to post my blog posts manually. (Maybe it was just because I didn’t bother to search for an efficient way to do it)</p> <h3 id="second-iteration-v20">Second Iteration V2.0</h3> <p>For my second website iteration, I actually got the idea two years ago after seeing my friend Jafar’s personal website (<a href="https://ajarifi.github.io/">here</a>). His website was also pretty neat, and then I noticed the URL, GitHub.</p> <p>I then searched about it and found out about <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. I like the customizable theme (with many templates) and the very simple blog post organization. Basically, to add a new blog post, just push a Git commit with the blog post formatted in Markdown in the posts folder, which I am familiar with. (I still can’t say I am good with Git and Markdown, though.)</p> <p>Then, when I found out that GitHub Pages is free and can use custom URLs, it was a no-brainer to choose it.</p> <h3 id="third-iteration-v30">Third Iteration V3.0</h3> <p>Fast-forward two years, and I haven’t made any blog posts on the second website. It turned out I was too lazy and unmotivated.</p> <p>This year, I thought to myself, I would like to make my ambitions a reality. For the last few years, I have been on and off in autopilot mode. While in recent years I felt much more in control, I felt I hadn’t done anything very productive beyond my work.</p> <p>Finally, after almost two years of delay, I launched my third iteration of my website (this one) and posted a fitting first blog post today!</p> <p>I hope this is not yet another futile attempt. Let’s see how this unfolds.</p>]]></content><author><name>Adrian</name></author><category term="general"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the first blog post for my second try to building a personal website.]]></summary></entry></feed>
