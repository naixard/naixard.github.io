### Lost Time

Until recently, I was (am still) overwhelmed by social media, such as Instagram and Facebook. My already limited free time at night after full-time work during the day was gone to oblivion, just to read and watch useless information.

I felt like my life was on autopilot. Suddenly, I realized some months had passed last year. Last year was probably my busiest year due to my wedding, but still, after that, everything else felt quick.

After I read Cal Newport's book Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World, I understood what was (maybe) happening to me. I spent too much time on shallow tasks, like browsing social media and using my smartphone, instead of doing deep work, which requires long uninterrupted concentration. 

For some weeks before I read this book, my average screen time was around six hours/day. *That's equal to my whole evening after work!* For comparison, my wife's average screen time was around one to two hours/day.

> Like the saying, "The phone is smart the person isn't."

### Embracing Boredom

After reading this book, I applied some of his advice, such as not using social media or time-blocking. One thing among the others is "embrace boredom." As I understand it, try letting your mind get bored without seeking entertainment. In my case, I basically try not to open my smartphone when bored (like when waiting).Â *Well, it is hard.*

The first few days were fine, but recently, I started going back to my old habit of looking at my phone. It seems I need to train my mind to do this.

### High Focus State Years Ago

I remember a deep work occasion during the *Pelatnas* (Indonesian term, *"Pelatihan Nasional"*, meaning "National Training") for International Olympiad of Astronomy and Astrophysics during my highschool days. 

I fondly remember there being no smartphone at that time. We were able to work long hours just to study college-level astronomy and astrophysics classes from the top university professors of the subjects in Indonesia (or maybe in SEA). Honestly, I want to return to that level of focus.

Back to the book, I really liked Deep Work. Cal Newport successfully reminded me of the critical things I was missing by forfeiting my time to shallow entertainment. I recommend giving this book a read if you feel the same way, if you feel your time is lost to the internet.
